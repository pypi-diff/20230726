-        
-        ![AutoCreateApp Logo](https://your-domain.com/path/to/your/logo.png)
-        
-        AutoCreateApp is a Python package that automates the process of creating Django projects with multiple apps and models based on user input. With this tool, you can quickly set up Django projects without manually creating apps, models, and migration files.
-        
-        ## Installation
-        
-        You can install AutoCreateApp via pip:
-        
-        ```bash
-        pip install autocreateapp
-        ```
-        
-        ## Usage
-        
-        Once AutoCreateApp is installed, you can use the `autocreateapp` command to create your Django project interactively.
-        
-        ```bash
-        autocreateapp
-        ```
-        
-        Follow the prompts to provide the project name, the number of apps to create, app names, model names, and model fields. The package will automatically generate the necessary files and set up the Django project with your specified apps and models.
-        
-        ## How It Works
-        
-        AutoCreateApp uses Python's built-in `os` module to create and navigate directories, and it utilizes Django's command-line tools (`django-admin` and `manage.py`) to create projects, apps, and migration files.
-        
-        The `add_app_to_installed_apps` function ensures that the newly created apps are added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the Django project's `settings.py` file.
-        
-        The package also supports interactive model creation, allowing you to specify model names and their respective fields, such as strings (`CharField`) or integers (`IntegerField`).
-        
-        ## Example
-        
-        Here's a simple example of how to use AutoCreateApp:
-        
-        ```bash
-        # Create a new Django project with two apps and models
-        autocreateapp
-        Enter the name of your Django project: myproject
-        How many apps do you want to create? 2
-        
-        Enter the name of your app: app1
-        Enter the name of your app: app2
-        
-        Enter the name of your first model in app1: MyModel
-        Enter model fields (comma-separated, e.g., name:str, age:int): name:str, age:int
-        
-        Enter the name of your first model in app2: AnotherModel
-        Enter model fields (comma-separated, e.g., title:str, description:str): title:str, description:str
-        ```
-        
-        After the above steps, you'll have a new Django project called `myproject`, with two apps (`app1` and `app2`), each containing one model (`MyModel` and `AnotherModel`) with the specified fields.
